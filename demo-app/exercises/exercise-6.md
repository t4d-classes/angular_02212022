# Exercise 6

1. Move the car data row to its own component named Car View Row.

2. Utilize the new Car View Row component in place of the current car data row in Car Table component.

Populate the edit row input fields with the data for the car when the row is shown.

The [formGroup] does not have to be applied to a form element. It can be applied to any element.
