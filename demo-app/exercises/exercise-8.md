# Exercise 8

1. Create a new service named `car-tool-store` in the `car-tool` module.

2. The `car-tool-store` service should manage application state for Car Tool.

3. The `car-home.component` can make use of the `car-tool-store` service to perform state operations, but the `car-home.component` should manage no application state within itself.

4. The `carToolStore` service can use other services.

5. Ensure it works!
